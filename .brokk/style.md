# Coding Style Guide

## General principles

1. **Null Away**: This project is built with Null Away: fields, parameter, and return values are non-null by default. 
Annotate exceptions to this rule with @Nullable (imported from org.jetbrains.annotations). Use requireNonNull 
(static import from java.util.Objects) when the static type is @Nullable but our code path expects it to be non-null.
Less often, it is useful to use castNonNull (static import from org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.util.NullnessUtil) 
when we can prove a value is not null but the compiler doesn't realize it, e.g. accessing get(true) in a Map 
returned by Collectors.partitioningBy. You do not need either requireNonNull or castNonNull when a field, parameter,
or return value is not annotated @Nullable.
1. **RedundantNullCheck**: Try to resolve `RedundantNullCheck` warnings by either removing the redundant null check or by annotating the reported variable or method with @Nullable (imported from org.jetbrains.annotations). Do NOT suppress the `RedundantNullCheck` warnings.
1. **@NullMarked**: Add `@org.jspecify.annotations.NullMarked` to `package-info.java` for any new Java source code packages.
1. **Java 21 features**: The codebase leverages Java features up to JDK 21. Embrace the lambdas! and also getFirst/getLast, Collectors.toList, pattern matching for instanceof, records and record patterns, etc.
1. **Prefer functional streams to manual loops**: Leverage streams for transforming collections, joining to Strings, etc.
1. **Favor Immutable Data Structures**: Prefer `List.of` and `Map.of`, as well as the Stream Collectors.
1. **Provide Comprehensive Logging**: Log relevant information using log4j, including request/response details, errors, and other important events.
1. **Use `var`**: Prefer `var` for local variable declarations. Exception: numeric types, such as `int`, `float`, etc.
1. **Multiline parameters**: When calling a method with more parameters than reasonably fit on one line, DO NOT leave dangling open or close parens on separate lines; instead, align as follows:
```
   var combined = Streams.concat(currentContext().readonlyFiles(),
                                 currentContext().virtualFragments(),
                                 Stream.of(currentContext().getAutoContext()));
```
  When declaring a method with multiline parameters, align similarly and also put the opening brace on a new line.
1. **Use asserts to validate assumptions**: Use `assert` to validate assumptions, and prefer making reasonable assumptions backed by assert to defensive `if` checks.
1. **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself. Refactor similar code into a common method. But feature flag parameters are a design smell; if you would need to add flags, write separate methods instead.
1. **Parsimony**: If you can write a general case that also generates correct results in the special case (empty input, maximum size, etc), then do so. Don't write special cases unless they are necessary.
1. **Use imports**: Never use raw, fully qualified class names; always import them.
1. **YAGNI**: Follow the principle of You Ain't Gonna Need It; implement the simplest solution that meets the requirements, unless you have specific knowledge that a more robust solution is needed to meet near-future requirements.

## Things to avoid

1. **No Unicode**: Don't use unicode characters in code. No fancy quotes, no fancy dashes, no fancy spaces, just plain ASCII.
1. **No DI, no mocking frameworks**: these usually lead to bad patterns where you spend more time refactoring tests than actually doing useful things. instead we give interfaces default implementations (UnsupportedOperationException is fine) to minimize boilerplate in tests.
1. **No StringBuilder**: prefer joins or interpolated text blocks where possible. Use stripIndent() with text blocks.
1. **Overcautious Exception Handling**: Let unexpected exceptions propagate up where they will be logged by a global handler. Don't catch unless you have context-specific handling to apply.

## GUI standards

1. **Swing thread safety**: Public methods that deal with Swing components should either assert they are being run on the EDT, or wrap in SwingUtilities.invokeLater. (Prefer `SwingUtil.runOnEdt(Callable<T> task, T defaultValue)` or `SwingUtil.runOnEdt(Runnable task)` to `SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait` when blocking for the result.)
1. **Popup dialogs**: IConsoleIO (implemented by Chrome) offers `systemNotify(String message, String title, int messageType)` and `toolError(String message, String title)` methods backed by JMessageDialog, prefer these for simple "OK" notifications 
1. **Named components**: Avoid navigating component hierarchies to retrieve a specific component by index or text. Save a reference as a field instead.
1. **Buttons**: Use io.github.jbellis.brokk.gui.components.MaterialButton instead of JButton. Use io.github.jbellis.brokk.gui.components.MaterialToggleButton instead of JToggleButton.
1. **Dialogs**: When building dialogs have buttons on the bottom. Start with a primary action button such as Ok or Done. It should have the following function applied to it io.github.jbellis.brokk.gui.SwingUtil.applyPrimaryButtonStyle(javax.swing.AbstractButton b). Next it should have a cancel button which is a normal io.github.jbellis.brokk.gui.components.MaterialButton with the text Cancel.
