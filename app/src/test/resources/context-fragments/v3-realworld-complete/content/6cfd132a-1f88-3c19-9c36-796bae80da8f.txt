In Blender, the Spin tool becomes inaccurate at high step counts: when I paste or reuse the result/parameters of a Spin operation, the geometry shows small but noticeable deviations that appear to be rounding errors. The final vertices are not where they should be for an exact angular distribution.
How can I fix this in code?
