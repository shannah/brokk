Add a regression test to catch drift: create a small test that runs `bmo_spin_exec` on a simple mesh (e.g., a single edge or a triangle) with a large number of steps (e.g., 200–1000), both with `dvec = 0` and with a non-zero `dvec`. For each intermediate step, compare positions of a representative vertex against the analytical target `cent + R(angle * i/steps) * (P0 - cent) [+ screw translation]` in `space` coordinates, asserting max deviation within a tight epsilon (e.g., 1e-6 to 1e-5 in float).
