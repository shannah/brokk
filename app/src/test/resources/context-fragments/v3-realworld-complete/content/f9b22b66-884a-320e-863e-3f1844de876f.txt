A regression test will be added for `bmo_spin_exec` to catch drift. The test will run `bmo_spin_exec` on a simple mesh with a large number of steps, comparing positions of a vertex against an analytical target. The test will be added in `tests/bmesh/test_bmo_spin.c`. The file `source/blender/bmesh/operators/bmo_dupe.cc` contains the code for `bmo_spin_exec` and will be included for reference. The Code Notes developer fragment was removed from the workspace.
