Reasoning:


**Deciding tool actions**

I need to plan my next steps regarding the user's question about fixing spin tool rounding errors at high steps. It seems we have some code fragments related to the spin operator but lack the actual implementation files, likely found in the bmesh operators like bmo_spin.cc. I should also consider using the BLI_math_rotation.h function for computing sine and cosine with integer fractions to help avoid cumulative errors in rotation. The rounding error happens because spin rotates incrementally, which leads to propagation issues.

**Exploring vertex computation**

To fix the issue, I need to calculate vertex positions using a precise rotation matrix based on the exact angle per step. Alternatively, I could use the sin_cos_from_fraction method to compute sine and cosine values for each step fraction, which helps prevent accumulation errors. Notably, the Screw modifier accurately computes steps across a full 360 degrees. I should search for existing BMO spin code and look for 'spin' operator or 'bmo_spin' function names within the bmesh operators.

**Pruning irrelevant fragments**

I need to prune any irrelevant fragments first. It seems the tool has a dropWorkspaceFragments feature to get rid of read-only fragments. I'm wondering if I should also prune Bmesh extrude files that aren't relevant. The spin code is in editmesh_extrude_spin.cc, but without bmo_spin.cc, I’ll need to add that file to the workspace for modification. My next step is to search for the file path using the searchSymbols function with 'spin' patterns.
