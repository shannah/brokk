Reasoning:


**Deciding tool actions**

I need to figure out the next steps for adding a regression test. As the Search Agent, my role is to prepare the workspace for the Code Agent without writing any code myself. So, I should add the test file path using the addFilesToWorkspace tool, but I can’t include the actual content. It seems that while I’m responsible for preparing, I still need to make sure the right paths to the files are set up for the Code Agent to write the code.

**Choosing test locations**

I need to pick a location that aligns with Blender's tests. It appears Blender uses the tests/blenkernel directory, but I want to find existing test patterns first. I'll search for any bmesh operator tests. Using searchFilenames, I could look for "tests" or "bmesh," since searching through symbols didn’t yield any tests previously. It might be helpful to search for "bmo_" usage or related test directories with the searchFilenames tool to find the appropriate "tests/" pattern.
