The task involved fixing compilation errors in `source/blender/bmesh/tests/test_bmo_spin_precision.cc`. This was achieved by adding `#include <array>`, replacing `std::vector<float3>` with `std::vector<std::array<float, 3>>`, and updating the code to use array indexing (`[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`) instead of `.x`, `.y`, `.z` when accessing elements of `co_orig_vec`. The build was successful after these changes.
