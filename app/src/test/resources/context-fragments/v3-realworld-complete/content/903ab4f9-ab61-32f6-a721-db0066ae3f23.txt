Reasoning:


**Adjusting tool calls**

I’ve realized that the related_classes list isn't needed. Instead, I’m focusing on two tool calls: dropWorkspaceFragments and searchFilenames. I need to provide explanations mapping for fragment IDs 30-36, stating they correspond to generic Summaries of BMElem and clarifying they're not required. For searchFilenames, I'll use the pattern [".*spin.*"]. Now it's time to implement these adjustments and return the array for tool_calls! Let's make sure everything is clear and understandable.
