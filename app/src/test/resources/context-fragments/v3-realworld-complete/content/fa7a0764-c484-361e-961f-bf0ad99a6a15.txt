        "instructions": "We need to adjust the Spin operator backend to correctly accumulate screw translation per step and to update the comment to reflect the accurate formulation.\n\nTarget file: source/blender/bmesh/operators/bmo_dupe.cc\nFunction: void bmo_spin_exec(BMesh *bm, BMOperator *op)\n\nContext: The file already contains an implementation that computes absolute per-step rotations (axis_angle_normalized_to_mat3 for angle_i) and repositions new vertices from stored original coordinates. However, the per-step screw translation currently uses a simplified formula: t_space = (i+1) * (R_i * dvec_space). This is not equivalent to the intended discrete sum of rotated translations and can deviate from the original behavior, especially at larger step counts. The goal is to accumulate the translation as the sum over steps using double precision to avoid rounding error, then convert to float when applying to vertices.\n\nMake the following changes:\n\n1) Update the precision note comment above bmo_spin_exec to describe the correct translation accumulation:\n- Replace the line that reads:\n  \"- Place new vertices directly using: P_i = cent + R_i * (P0 - cent) + (i + 1) * (R_i * dvec_space), transforming positions into and out of the provided 'space' matrix.\"\n  with something like:\n  \"- Place new vertices directly using: P_i = cent + R_i * (P0 - cent) + sum_{k=1..i} (R_k * dvec_space) (accumulated in double precision), transforming positions into and out of the provided 'space' matrix.\"\n  Keep the rest of the comment unchanged.\n\n2) Implement precise screw-translation accumulation:\n- Just before the for-loop over steps (for (a = 0; a < steps; a++)), declare a double-precision accumulator initialized to zero:\n  double t_accum[3] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0};\n\n- Inside the loop, after computing rmat_i for angle_i, replace the current computation of t_space that uses (i+1) * (R_i * dvec_space) with a per-step delta added to t_accum. Specifically, remove or overwrite this block:\n  \"/* Closed-form screw translation: (i + 1) * (R_i * dvec_space). */\\n  float t_space[3] = {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f};\\n  if (use_dvec) {\\n    copy_v3_v3(t_space, dvec_space);\\n    mul_m3_v3(rmat_i, t_space);\\n    mul_v3_fl(t_space, float(step_index));\\n  }\"\n\n  Replace it with:\n  \"/* Accumulate screw translation precisely as sum_{k=1..i} R_k * dvec_space (double precision). */\\n  float t_space[3] = {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f};\\n  if (use_dvec) {\\n    float delta_space[3];\\n    copy_v3_v3(delta_space, dvec_space);\\n    mul_m3_v3(rmat_i, delta_space);\\n    t_accum[0] += (double)delta_space[0];\\n    t_accum[1] += (double)delta_space[1];\\n    t_accum[2] += (double)delta_space[2];\\n    t_space[0] = (float)t_accum[0];\\n    t_space[1] = (float)t_accum[1];\\n    t_space[2] = (float)t_accum[2];\\n  }\"\n\n- Ensure that t_space (float[3]) computed as above is then used unchanged in the per-vertex repositioning for both the duplicate and extrude branches (as it is now).\n\n3) Do not change any other logic (duplicate/extrude topology generation, use_merge last-step splicing, storage of original indices, or the space/world transforms). Ensure co_orig and vtable memory management remains as-is.\n\nAfter making these changes, please build to verify there are no compilation errors.",
