The Brokk Search Agent is preparing the workspace for the Code Agent to add a regression test for `bmo_spin_exec` in Blender's BMesh library. It starts by searching for relevant symbols and filenames related to "spin" operations. Unnecessary workspace fragments related to generic BMElem summaries are removed. A placeholder test file `source/blender/bmesh/tests/test_bmo_spin_precision.c` is added, along with a detailed note explaining the test's purpose, implementation details, setup, execution, and analytical transform and comparison, including error tolerances and step counts. Existing BMesh unit tests are located to mirror their structure, and the content of `bmesh_core_test.cc` is retrieved to extract typical includes and test harness patterns. Finally, the agent calls `workspaceComplete` to signal that the workspace is ready for the Code Agent. The agent had initial difficulties creating the new file, but it was resolved by focusing on adding the necessary context to the workspace, including code snippets and summaries.
