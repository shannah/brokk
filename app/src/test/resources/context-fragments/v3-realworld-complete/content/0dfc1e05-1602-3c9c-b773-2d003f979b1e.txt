Reasoning:


**Considering rounding errors in spin tool**

I need to provide tool calls because I'm acting as a Search Agent. I currently have two files in my workspace: BLI_math_rotation.h and editmesh_extrude_spin.cc. I've identified rounding errors in the Spin tool at high steps. It seems that bmo_spin_exec is responsible for the rotation calculations. I need to check how it accumulates angles — whether through matrix multiplication or translation, as that could lead to errors. 

To fix this, I might compute sin/cos from fractions, or use quaternion interpolation for smoother rotations. Maybe the spin operator already rotates effectively with total angles, but I need to verify that!

**Investigating bmo_spin_exec implementation**

I need to read the code for bmo_spin_exec. My tools suggest I can fetch method sources, but they’re more tailored for Java. However, it seems I got C++ info from the searchSymbols/getFileContents before. The tool "getFileContents" showed the definition and declaration of bmo_spin_exec, but not its actual source. 

I think the implementation might be in source/blender/bmesh/operators/bmo_spin.cc. Since searchFilenames didn't yield results, I’ll search for "bmo_spin_exec(" to locate the implementation, along with comments related to "Spin" and "BM_mesh." I want to focus on relevant fragments, including that bug description about the Spin Tool.

**Analyzing rotation definitions**

In my editable files, BLI_math_rotation.h has the sin_cos_from_fraction function declared, which I think I'll use for the fix. The file editmesh_extrude_spin.cc is more of a user-level operator, but it's nice for parameter definitions. I noticed the documentation states "Rotation for each step," while the UI and BMOpDefine mentions "Total rotation angle." 

It seems there’s a mismatch since they're passing "-angle" and "steps" to BMO. If this angle is taken as total rotation instead of per-step, it could lead to repeated application. The key issue, though, is the rounding errors. I need a better way to compute positions directly instead of through repeated transformations!

**Planning a fix for bmo_spin_exec**

I think the fix could involve changing the implementation of bmo_spin_exec to compute the transform for each step. If "angle" is meant to be per-step, then I could use angle_i = angle * (i). Alternatively, if it's total rotation, I'd apply angle_total * (i / steps) to get the per-step angle. 

The UI and BMOpDefine seem mismatched regarding "Total rotation angle." I need to find the code, and since earlier tools returned bmo_spin_exec, I can use addMethodsToWorkspace. However, since that tool is meant for Java, I might need to find the source path in C++. I’ll search for "bmo_spin_exec" and related terms in bmesh operators.

**Implementing rotation changes**

I’m considering how to handle cases when the angle is around 2π to achieve symmetrical endpoints. It might also be useful to check "use_auto_merge," since it triggers with a full revolution. For that, I could compute the rotation using sin_cos_from_fraction to position points precisely. However, to minimize changes, I’ll implement direct computation per step.

Now, for the tool calls, I need to keep the relevant workspace fragments, like the read-only bug report and editable files. I must search for the path of bmo_spin_exec by issuing searchSubstrings for function implementations now! I'll look for patterns like "bmo_spin_exec\\s*\\(" and "spin.*exec\\s*\\(".I need to create a task list since code changes are necessary. However, the instructions clearly state that the final actions—like answering, creating the task list, marking the workspace as complete, or aborting the search—should be the only tool used in a turn. So, before I can finalize anything, I need to make sure to perform all the necessary tool calls to retrieve and add the relevant files. Let's move forward with the searches!
