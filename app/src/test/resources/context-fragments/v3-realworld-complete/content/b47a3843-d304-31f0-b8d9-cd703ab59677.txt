A new test file `test_bmo_spin_precision.cc` was added to test the precision of the spin operator (`bmo_spin_exec`). The test creates a simple mesh with two vertices and one edge, then applies the spin operator with a high number of steps, both with and without a translation component (dvec). The resulting vertex positions are compared against analytically computed target positions. The CMakeLists.txt file needs to be updated to include the new test file in the build. The test validates the absolute-per-step transform and precise screw translation accumulation, checking for cumulative drift. Helper functions for angle calculation, expected position computation, and screw translation accumulation are included. Two test cases were added: `SpinPrecision_PureRotation` and `SpinPrecision_Screw`.
