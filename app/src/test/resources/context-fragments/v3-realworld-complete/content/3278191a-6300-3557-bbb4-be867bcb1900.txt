The `bmo_spin_exec` function in `bmo_dupe.cc` will be modified to address incremental rotation drift caused by floating-point errors. The new implementation computes absolute per-step transforms from the original geometry to avoid cumulative errors. Original vertex indices and positions are recorded upfront. Transforms are prepared by inverting the space matrix and converting relevant data to the space coordinate system. Numerically stable rotations are achieved using quaternions for absolute rotation at each step. Screw translation is accumulated precisely using double precision. Per-step incremental rotate/translate operations are replaced with direct coordinate assignment. The full-revolution merge behavior (`use_merge`) is preserved, ensuring correct topology handling during merging.
