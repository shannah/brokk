The `bmo_spin_exec` function in `bmo_dupe.cc` was modified to address incremental rotation drift by computing absolute per-step transforms. The changes include: adding a documentation note, storing original vertex indices and coordinates, preparing space transforms, replacing incremental rotate/translate with absolute transforms, preserving merge behavior for the last iteration, and freeing allocated memory. The build error due to the incorrect `BMO_slot_mat_get` function was fixed by replacing it with `BMO_slot_mat4_get`.
