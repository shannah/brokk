The Brokk Architect is creating a regression test for the Spin operator (`bmo_spin_exec`) to detect drift in precision. It adds existing bmesh test files (`bmesh_core_test.cc`, `CMakeLists.txt`), relevant header files (`bmesh.h`, `bmesh.hh`, `bmesh_operators.h`, `BLI_math_rotation.h`, `BLI_math_matrix.h`, `BLI_math_vector.h`) to the workspace, then calls the Code Agent to create `test_bmo_spin_precision.cc`. The Code Agent is instructed to build a minimal mesh, implement a test driver function to run the spin operator with specified parameters (steps, angle, dvec), compute expected vertex positions, compare them against actual positions with a defined epsilon, and add two specific tests (`SpinPrecision_PureRotation`, `SpinPrecision_Screw`). The Code Agent is also tasked with updating `CMakeLists.txt` to include the new test file. The goal is to ensure the spin operator's absolute-per-step transform and screw translation accumulation eliminate cumulative drift.
