Reasoning:

Processing **analyzed** and **unanalyzed** files in parallel
Analyzed files reasoning:



**Considering regression test recommendations**

I need to recommend relevant files and classes for adding a regression test for bmo_spin_exec. The editable file bmo_dupe.cc contains the code for bmo_spin_exec, so I’ll likely need to add a test file in the tests directory for BMesh operators. The goal is to create a small test running bmo_spin_exec on a simple mesh and compare positions to catch any drift. I need to determine the files to include and recommend a new test file path as well as relevant classes to summarize.

**Determining test file paths and classes**

Okay, I need to specify fully-qualified class names for the classesToSummarize, but the summary list doesn’t include those names. The tool expects an array with these class names, even if we don’t have any to include; I can pass an empty array if none are relevant. The bmo_spin_exec is in an editable file, but I only need to add a test, not modify it. I’m considering paths for the new test file, either under tests/bmesh or tests/blenkernel, likely settling on source/blender/bmesh/operators/tests/test_bmo_spin.c.

**Including needed files in recommendations**

I’m thinking I might need to add header prototypes for bmo_spin_exec, which is declared as a static function. It’s set up as void bmo_spin_exec(BMesh*, BMOperator*), so the test will need to construct BMesh and BMOperator, setting up slots to call this function. I’ll need helper functions like BMO_op_init and BM functions, but there's no need to specify them in recommendContext. The essential part is adding the new test file path to filesToAdd, along with bmo_dupe.cc for reference since it's in the editable workspace.

**Preparing JSON structure**

I’m ready to craft the JSON structure. For the filesToAdd array, I’ll include both the path to bmo_dupe.cc and the new test file test_bmo_spin.c, like this: ["source/blender/bmesh/operators/bmo_dupe.cc", "tests/bmesh/test_bmo_spin.c"]. I won’t include anything for classesToSummarize since there are no relevant classes. I’ll ensure the JSON object contains a tool_calls array with a single object, so everything is nicely organized and ready to go!
```json
{
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "name": "recommendContext",
      "arguments": {
        "filesToAdd": [
          "source/blender/bmesh/operators/bmo_dupe.cc",
          "tests/bmesh/test_bmo_spin.c"
        ],
        "classesToSummarize": []
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
