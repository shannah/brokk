A regression test `test_bmo_spin_precision.cc` was added to exercise the BMesh Spin operator (`bmo_spin_exec`) and detect cumulative drift. The test creates a minimal mesh, invokes the spin operator with high step counts for pure rotation and screw translation, compares generated vertex positions against analytical target positions with tight tolerances, and asserts no deviation. It uses identity space, the original-vertex index written into `v->no` to map duplicates, and sorts duplicates by angular position. The build succeeded with the new test.
