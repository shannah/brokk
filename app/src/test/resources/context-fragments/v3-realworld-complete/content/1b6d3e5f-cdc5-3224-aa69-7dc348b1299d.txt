> Likely fix:
Compute axis_space = normalize(M3(space) * axis).
Use axis_space to build rmat_i.
Use axis_space in the screw accumulation as well.
Your tests use identity space, so they won’t catch this. Consider adding a test with a non-identity space to verify.

add first the test, I will execute it to confirm it fails
