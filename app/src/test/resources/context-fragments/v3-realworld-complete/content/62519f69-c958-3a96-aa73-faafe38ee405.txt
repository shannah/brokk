The Spin operator in `source/blender/bmesh/operators/bmo_dupe.cc` (specifically `bmo_spin_exec`) was fixed to improve precision and avoid incremental-rotation drift. The changes include: adding a precision note, recording original vertex data, preparing the transform context correctly, using absolute per-step transforms instead of incremental ones, precisely accumulating screw translation, directly assigning coordinates to new vertices, preserving `use_merge` behavior, and freeing allocated memory. The fix uses absolute axis-angle per step for numerical stability and improves the precision of screw translation. A build was verified successfully.
