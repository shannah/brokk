The agent identified and corrected type errors in `test_bmo_spin_precision.cc` to ensure it compiles. Specifically, it replaced the undefined `float3` type with `std::array<float, 3>`, included the `<array>` header, and updated the code to use array indexing. The agent then marked the project as finished, confirming a successful build and the addition of a new regression test for the Spin operator, testing both pure rotation and screw translation. The test relies on analytical transforms and asserts vertex position accuracy.
