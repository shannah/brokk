The task involves preparing a workspace for the Code Agent to fix a floating-point drift issue in the `bmo_spin_exec` function within `source/blender/bmesh/operators/bmo_dupe.cc`. The fix involves modifying the function to compute absolute rotations and translations for each step of the spin operation instead of applying incremental transformations, which accumulate rounding errors. The original vertex indices and coordinates are stored to allow for correct repositioning. The workspace is pruned to remove unrelated fragments and a detailed note is appended, providing step-by-step instructions, memory considerations, and testing guidance for the Code Agent, without making any code edits. The workspace is then marked as complete.
