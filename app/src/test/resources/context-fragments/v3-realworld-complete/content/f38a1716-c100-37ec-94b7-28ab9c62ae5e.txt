The Code Agent attempted to add a regression test for the `bmo_spin_exec` function to detect drift. The test would involve running the function on a simple mesh with a high number of steps and comparing the positions of a vertex against an analytically calculated target. The agent requested existing project files (`bmesh_core_test.cc`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `bmesh_operators.h`, and any shared test helper header) to ensure proper compilation and integration with the existing test harness. However, the task was terminated without any changes because the requested files were not provided.
