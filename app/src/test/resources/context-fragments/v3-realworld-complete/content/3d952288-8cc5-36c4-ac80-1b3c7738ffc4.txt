Reasoning:


**Pruning and exploring options**

I'm in the role of a Search Agent, starting by eliminating irrelevant fragments to clear the workspace. I see a readonly issue description for the Spin Tool imprecision and a discarded context map, which is fine. There are editable files, including a header file and an implementation file where I need to address a rounding error with high step counts. I’ll consider fixing the math in the backend to ensure more robust calculations. I could use either quaternion exponentiation or compute incremental transforms to avoid cumulative errors.

**Searching for BMesh code**

I’m trying to track down the BMesh operator `bmo_spin_exec` in the BMesh operators file. I've already used searchSymbols to locate `bmo_spin_def` and `bmo_spin_exec`. Now I need to add these methods to my workspace for further inspection. It seems the addMethodsToWorkspace tool requires fully qualified names, although the system is optimized for Java, it's been adapted for C++ too. I’ll check if “getMethodSources” functions correctly with C++ names. Honestly, I might try searchFilenames for `bmo_spin.*` too and fetch the file contents that reference these. Also, I want to look at the relevant function in `BLI_math_rotation.h`.

**Examining implementation details**

I’m realizing the implementation I need is likely in `BLI_math_rotation.c` or something similar, and I might need to reference it for the fix. The solution might involve modifying the spin operator to use `sin_cos_from_fraction` for distributing steps when working with a full revolution or known angles. I’ll need to read the operator code to understand the current algorithm better. So, I’ll search for `bmo_spin.cc` and check for any occurrences of "BMO_op_define" related to spin. After that, I'll develop a detailed task list for the necessary code changes.

**Checking for function accessibility**

I need to ensure that the `BLI sin_cos_from_fraction` function exists and is accessible in the header file. It seems to be there, which is a relief! I should also consider any merging during a full revolution, but let’s focus on the immediate tasks. I’ll use `searchFilenames` to locate `bmo_spin.*` files and also check for `bmo_spin.c`. After that, I'll retrieve the file contents to analyze the `bmo_spin_exec` function and see if it’s defined in the generic table. Then I can decide whether to add file contents or files to the workspace.

**Preparing tasks for code updates**

I’m thinking through the process of updating the BMesh operator `bmo_spin_exec`. First, I need to inspect the implementation with `getFileContents` before using `addFilesToWorkspace` to allow edits later. The goal is to adjust the transform calculation to ensure accuracy. The problem with angular rounding needs addressing, especially when duplicating increments. I’ll specifically read the current behavior, confirming how it handles angles and steps. 

Finally, I’ll formulate tasks: refining the transformation method for better precision and caching original positions, and exploring the use of `sin_cos_from_fraction` where applicable for smoother distribution. Let’s proceed with the necessary searches.

**Creating tool calls**

I’m working on producing JSON tool calls, specifically including [searchFilenames, getFileContents]. I might add a call to searchSubstrings to identify where “spin” uses “transforms,” but I should read the file first. There’s also the option to proactively call addFilesToWorkspace. The Code Agent will need to modify `bmo_spin.c`, so I'm considering that as well. I’ll go ahead and create the JSON with those two calls.
