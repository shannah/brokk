The Spin operator backend in `source/blender/bmesh/operators/bmo_dupe.cc` was updated to accumulate screw translation per step using double precision to avoid rounding errors. The comment above `bmo_spin_exec` was updated to reflect this accurate formulation. The simplified translation calculation `(i+1) * (R_i * dvec_space)` was replaced with a summation of rotated translations. A double-precision accumulator `t_accum` was added before the loop, and the per-step translation was added to it within the loop, converting to float before applying to vertices. The changes were verified by building the project.
