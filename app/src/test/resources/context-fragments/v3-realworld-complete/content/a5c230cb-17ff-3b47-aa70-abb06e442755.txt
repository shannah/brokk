# Architect complete

Added a regression test (source/blender/bmesh/tests/test_bmo_spin_precision.cc) that exercises the BMesh Spin operator backend (bmo_spin_exec) to detect cumulative drift. The test builds a minimal mesh (single edge), invokes the spin operator with large step counts in two configurations: pure rotation (dvec=0) and screw translation (small non-zero dvec). For each step, the test computes the analytical absolute target position P_target = cent + R(angle_total * i/steps) * (P0 - cent) [+ accumulated screw translation in double precision], compares against the generated vertex positions with tight epsilons (1e-6 for pure rotation, 1e-5 for screw), and asserts no deviation. The test relies on identity space and axis=(0,0,1), uses the original-vertex index written into v->no by bmo_spin_exec to map duplicates back to their originals, and sorts duplicates by angular position to align each to its step. Build succeeded with the new test in place.Project final answer: Added a regression test (source/blender/bmesh/tests/test_bmo_spin_precision.cc) that exercises the BMesh Spin operator backend (bmo_spin_exec) to detect cumulative drift.
