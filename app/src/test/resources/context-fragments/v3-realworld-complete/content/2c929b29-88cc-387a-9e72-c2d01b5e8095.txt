The task involves modifying the Spin operator backend (bmo_spin_exec in source/blender/bmesh/operators/bmo_dupe.cc) to accurately accumulate screw translation per step. The current implementation uses a simplified formula that deviates from the intended behavior, especially at larger step counts. The changes include updating a comment to accurately describe the translation accumulation, implementing precise screw-translation accumulation using double-precision, and ensuring the computed translation is used unchanged in per-vertex repositioning. No other logic should be modified, and the changes should be verified with a build to confirm no compilation errors are introduced.
