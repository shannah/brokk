The task focuses on fixing a precision issue in Blender's Spin tool (`bmo_spin_exec` in `bmo_dupe.cc`) where incremental rotations cause cumulative floating-point errors at high step counts. The fix involves computing absolute transforms from the original (step-0) vertex positions for each step, instead of transforming the previous step's geometry. Key steps include storing original vertex data, using stable rotation math (quaternions), accumulating translation in double precision, and directly assigning vertex coordinates. The existing merge behavior for full revolutions should be preserved. A regression test is recommended to ensure the fix eliminates drift.
